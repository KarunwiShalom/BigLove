# BigLove
In-depth examination of sales revenue data for a seller of wholesale coffee beans over a four-year period—from January 2019 to June 2022—was the focus of this project. Acquiring practical knowledge about revenue patterns, market dynamics, and sales performance was the aim in order to support strategic decision-making.

“Big Love” is a fictional company name I assigned to the dataset. A wholesale company that sells coffee beans in kilogram packages to individuals. It comprised coffee bean sales made to customers across three countries over four years. It was, however, a real-life dataset with altered names and addresses to protect client information.

Downloaded from a Github repository, I opened it up on MS Excel, and it had three tables:
- Orders contained information about each coffee bean order made within the period. It had five (5) columns and one thousand (1000) rows. It had two unique identifiers (Customer ID and Product ID) that could connect to the other tables.
- Customers: this contained information about each customer who made a coffee bean purchase within the period. It had nine (9) columns and one thousand (1000) rows.
- Products: It contained information about each coffee bean available during the period. It had seven (7) columns and forty-nine (49) rows.

# Business Questions

In working on this dataset, I aimed to replicate a real-life scenario where a small-medium scale business could view its year-on-year data and identify key insights for growth and strategy.

After previewing the dataset, I knew I needed to merge the information in the three tables into one, which would be the basis for the dashboard.

I identified the following as key insights that would be valuable to stakeholders within the business:
Total Sales by Country: The dataset covered three countries, so I could identify the countries generating the most revenue and the gap between them.
Sales over Time: crucial for every business, I wanted to analyse the sales numbers over the three years of sales to view how profitable the company has been
Customer Insights: I wanted to view the top purchasing customers and the volume with which they order coffee beans.
Loyalty: since there was a column showing if each customer had a loyalty card, I decided to check if returning customers had the card and were purchasing in high volumes and if those who did not have the card were one-off customers.
Product Insights: I wanted to view the product generating the most revenue regarding roast type and bag size.
